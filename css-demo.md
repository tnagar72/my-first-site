## Without CSS Styling

This page uses the same HTML structure as the contact page, but without CSS styling.

Notice how the navigation links appear as plain text links in a row, not as a styled navigation bar.

**Key Points:**
- HTML structure determines the ORDER of elements
- CSS styling determines the APPEARANCE of elements
- The `<nav>` element comes first in HTML, so it appears first on the page
- CSS makes it look like a proper navigation bar with background color, padding, etc.
