# About This Site

This is my Jekyll learning project where I'm mastering static site generation from the ground up.

## What I've Learned

- **Jekyll basics** - File structure, front matter, layouts
- **Templating** - Liquid variables, loops, conditionals  
- **Navigation** - Linking pages, data files, includes
- **Collections** - Organizing content beyond posts
- **Sass** - Variables, nesting, mixins, compilation
- **Site organization** - Best practices and maintainable structure

## Learning Goal

My goal is to eventually create sophisticated sites like Fred Hohman's portfolio, building skills progressively from these fundamentals.
