## About This Journey

This site represents my comprehensive learning path through Jekyll and static site generation. Starting from absolute basics, I've built up skills in:

- **Modern web architecture** with Jekyll's powerful templating system
- **Professional development practices** including version control and deployment
- **Responsive design** with Sass and modern CSS techniques
- **Content management** through collections, data files, and organized structure

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on mastering advanced Jekyll patterns and studying professional portfolio sites to understand sophisticated design and development techniques.

## Connect & Learn

Feel free to explore my projects and learning demos. This site serves as both a portfolio and a documentation of my development journey.
